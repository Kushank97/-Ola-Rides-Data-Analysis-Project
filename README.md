# 🚕 Ola Rides Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of **Ola ride bookings** using **SQL** for data extraction and **Power BI** for visualization. The dataset contains over **100,000+ ride records**, offering deep insights into customer behavior, ride patterns, cancellations, and payment trends.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- **SQL (MySQL)** – for querying and transforming ride data
- **Power BI** – for creating interactive dashboards and data storytelling
- **Excel** – for initial exploration and data inspection

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives:
- Understand customer and driver behaviors
- Identify top users and ride preferences
- Analyze cancellation reasons and payment methods
- Visualize ride performance metrics and ratings

---

## 🔍 SQL Insights:
I created multiple SQL views to answer key business questions such as:

1. ✅ **All successful bookings**  
   → Filtered all rides where the booking status was marked as 'Success'.

2. 📏 **Average ride distance per vehicle type**  
   → Calculated average distances for each ride category like Mini, Prime Sedan, etc.

3. ❌ **Total rides cancelled by customers**  
   → Identified cancellation patterns from the customer side.

4. 🏆 **Top 5 customers by ride volume**  
   → Found the most loyal/high-usage customers.

5. 🚫 **Rides cancelled by drivers for personal/car issues**  
   → Analyzed driver-side cancellations and common reasons.

6. ⭐ **Driver ratings for Prime Sedan rides**  
   → Retrieved max and min driver ratings for premium vehicles.

7. 💸 **Rides paid via UPI**  
   → Filtered transactions based on the payment method.

8. 🌟 **Average customer ratings per vehicle type**  
   → Compared customer satisfaction across vehicle categories.

9. 💰 **Total value of successfully completed bookings**  
   → Summed booking revenue from completed rides only.

10. 📋 **Incomplete rides with reasons**  
    → Investigated uncompleted rides and documented their causes.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights:
- Interactive filters by **Vehicle Type**, **City**, **Booking Status**
- KPIs: **Total Successful Rides**, **Cancelled Rides**, **Total Revenue**
- Visuals: Bar charts, Donut charts, Line graphs, and Map visuals
- Breakdown of **driver vs. customer cancellations**
- Customer & Driver **rating distributions**
- **Payment method usage** comparison (UPI, Card, Cash, etc.)

## 📎 Dataset:
This project was based on a simulated Ola rides dataset with over **100,000+ rows**, covering fields such as:
- Booking ID, Customer ID, Vehicle Type
- Booking Status, Ratings, Payment Method
- Distance, Revenue, Cancellation reasons
